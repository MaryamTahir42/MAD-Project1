# HealthWire – Android UI Design

**HealthWire** is a simple Android application that focuses on the design of user interface (UI) screens for **Login**, **Sign Up**, and **Dashboard**. The primary goal of this project is to create clean and functional layouts without navigation or backend functionality.

## Project Overview

HealthWire provides a UI for users to interact with:

- **Login Screen** for user authentication.
- **Sign-Up Screen** to create a new user account.
- **Dashboard Screen** as the main landing page after login/sign-up.

This project focuses solely on the front-end layout using XML in Android Studio, showcasing responsive design for various screen sizes.
